# MDN Web Docs Community

üëã Welcome to the MDN Web Docs project! We are delighted with your interest in this project.

At MDN, we put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate, and respect the diversity of our global contributors.
We welcome contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute constructively and respectfully to this project.

`mdn-community` is the repository where you will find the [public feedback discussions](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions) for the MDN Web Docs project.

> **Note:** By participating in and contributing to our projects and discussions, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the [Mozilla community participation guidelines](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## GitHub discussions

On MDN Web Docs, we encourage our community to start and engage in discussions around topics related to the overall project.
We ask that you keep each discussion focused on the topic at hand, instead of covering multiple topics in one discussion.

**NOTE:** mdn-community/discussions is not the place to report problems.
For content-related problems on MDN Web Docs, raise issues in the [relevant project](https://github.com/mdn/).
If you're not sure whether to open an issue or a discussion, consider these points:

- **Issues** are for reporting a bug, and have a clear and actionable outcome.
- **Discussions** are for sharing ideas or possible solutions to a problem. They are a place to agree upon a course of action.

Check out the definition of each discussion category below so that you can start your discussion in the right place.

> **A note on discussions labelled as archived**: We label some discussions with an `archive` label because we occasionally find two or more discussions about the same topic.
> You cannot merge two discussions into one, so our workaround is to **add a link in the most active discussion** that references the least active discussion(s).
> We will lock older discussions and add the `archived` label, which allows us to keep the older discussion history but focus on active discussions.

## Participation guideline highlights

To ensure we maintain a healthy, friendly, and welcoming community, we want to highlight the behaviours we expect from our community.

### Expected behaviours

- **Being respectful**
  - Value each other‚Äôs ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners.
- **Being direct but professional**
  - We¬†must¬†be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
- **Being inclusive**
  - Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices.
- **Understanding different perspectives**
  - Our goal should not be to ‚Äúwin‚Äù every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better.
- **Appreciating and accommodating our similarities and differences**
  - Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices.
    Think of others‚Äô needs from their point of view.
- **Leading by example**
  - Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviours. Make decisions based on the highest good.

As important as knowing how you **should** conduct yourself is understanding unacceptable conduct.

### Unacceptable behaviours

- **Violence and threats of violence**
  - Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline.
- **Personal attacks**
  - Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean, or belittle others.
- **Derogatory language**
  - If you‚Äôre unsure if a word is derogatory, don‚Äôt use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behaviour in question.
- **Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact**
  - This includes sexualised comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications, or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances.
- **Disruptive behaviour**
  - Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated.
